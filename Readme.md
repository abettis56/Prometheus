Hi, welcome to Prometheus!

This is a personal video game project I'm making to learn Unity and C#.

Enclosed you'll find all aspects of the project except for the art assets.
The reason for those being absent is that for prototyping, I'm currently using the
World of Solaria assets pack, which you can find here:

Check it out, it's really cool! I don't want to redistribute the assets though,
as such I can't put the files in this public repo. If you'd like to recompile this yourself,
you can include 16x16 assets of your own. I'll put some freeware placeholder assets in soon.
